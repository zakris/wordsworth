                I think poetry is a medium for self expression that isn’t widely accepted in today’s culture, 
                    but has the potential to be much more widely used. <br>
                I hope this app will act as the spark to that potential, 
                    to ignite into an explosion of creative potential! <br>

                I like poetry but often find it dense and inaccessible. <br>
                I see this project as narrowly answering the question: 
                    “can technology make art more accessible and interesting to people?” <br>
                I am excited to work towards answering such a question! <br>
                My favorite poet is George Herbet. <br>
                I have some experience in Java, C++, and Dart. <br>
